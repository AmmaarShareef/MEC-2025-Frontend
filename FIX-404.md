# Fix 404 Errors on GitHub Pages

## The Problem
404 errors mean your assets (CSS/JS files) can't be found. This happens when the base path doesn't match your repository name.

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Find Your Exact Repository Name
1. Go to: https://github.com/AmmaarShareef
2. Find your repository
3. Look at the URL: `github.com/AmmaarShareef/REPO-NAME`
4. Copy the exact repository name (case-sensitive!)

### Step 2: Update Configuration
Once you know your repo name, I'll update:
- `vite.config.js` - base path
- `package.json` - homepage URL

### Step 3: Rebuild and Redeploy
```bash
npm run build
git add .
git commit -m "Fix base path for GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

## Common Repository Names
- `MEC-2025-Frontend` ✅
- `mec-2025-frontend` ❌ (lowercase - won't work!)
- `MEC2025Frontend` ❌ (no dashes - won't work!)
- `Pheonix-AID` ❌ (different name - won't work!)

## What to Check
1. **Browser Console (F12)**: Look for which files are 404
   - If it says: `404 /MEC-2025-Frontend/assets/...`
   - But your repo is: `mec-2025-frontend`
   - That's the problem!

2. **Your GitHub URL**: 
   - If you access: `https://AmmaarShareef.github.io/MEC-2025-Frontend/`
   - But your repo is named: `mec-2025-frontend`
   - The URL should be: `https://AmmaarShareef.github.io/mec-2025-frontend/`

## Tell Me Your Repository Name
